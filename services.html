         <h3><u>Music Production</u></h3>
        <br>
         <h4><u>Oxtail</u></h4>
         <p>Producing for hip-hop acts for over 10 years, Oxtail (Formerly BeatsByBAGS) is our in-house producer (as well as co-owner of Amnesia 11). With a wide array of sounds and styles at his arsenal, Oxtail still manages to have a signature style that's instantly recognizable.</p>
         <br>
         <h4><u>J-Mist</u></h4>
         <p>Originally producing on the legendary Neko workstation, J-Mist's style isn't your typical jazzy boom-bap. Utilizing unique drump patterns and sequencing, his affinity for early 90's hip-hop is definitely an influence, but not the only trick he has up his sleeve.</p>

         <h3><u>A&R/Executive Production</u></h3>
         <p>With an immense love for music, and more specifically, the projects that contain them (albums), Syvaun Grullon was playlisting before it was a word. Often creating his own concept-based mixes, at some point his ear for what works, what doesn't, and how to sequence it all became evident. Along with long time collaborator Oxtail, they've Executive Produced and A&R'd multiple projects to see that the end product is finished with a level of polish and sophistication usually seen on much higher budget releases.</p>
